        "   1) Python is a general-purpose, high-level, object-oriented programming language that's used for many different purposes, including: Building websites and software, Automating tasks, Analyzing data, Machine learning, and Data science.\n",
        "   Python's popularity stems from a combination of factors that make it an attractive choice for both beginners and experienced programmers:\n",
        "\n",
        "Readability and Ease of Use: Python's syntax is clear, concise, and resembles natural English, making it relatively easy to learn and understand. This reduces the learning curve for beginners and allows developers to write code more quickly.\n",

        "Extensive Libraries and Frameworks: Python boasts a vast collection of libraries and frameworks that provide pre-written code for common tasks. This saves developers time and effort, allowing them to focus on the unique aspects of their projects. Popular libraries include NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data analysis, and Django for web development.\n",

        "6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "6) The difference in mutability between lists and tuples stems from their intended use cases and underlying design:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Lists are designed to be flexible and dynamic collections of items. They are meant to be modified, extended, and rearranged frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementation: Lists are implemented as dynamic arrays. This means they can grow or shrink in size as needed, and elements can be inserted or removed at any position. This flexibility necessitates mutability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples:\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Tuples are intended to represent fixed collections of heterogeneous data. They are often used to group related pieces of information that should not be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementation: Tuples are implemented as static arrays. This means their size is fixed at creation, and elements cannot be added or removed. This fixed structure naturally lends itself to immutability.\n",
        "Here's a deeper dive into the reasoning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Integrity: Tuples are often used to store data that should not be accidentally modified, such as coordinates, database records, or function arguments. Immutability ensures the integrity of this data, preventing unintended changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Hashability: Immutability allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets. Dictionaries and sets require their keys and elements to be hashable, meaning they have a fixed value that can be used for efficient lookup. Mutable objects like lists are not hashable because their value can change.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Performance: In some cases, tuples can offer performance benefits over lists due to their immutability. Since tuples are fixed in size, Python can optimize their memory allocation and access, leading to potentially faster operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Code Clarity: By using tuples to represent fixed collections, you make your code more readable and maintainable. It's clear to other developers that the data stored in a tuple is not intended to be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are mutable because they are designed for dynamic collections that need to be changed frequently.\n",

        "Tuples are immutable because they represent fixed collections where data integrity and hashability are important"

        "\n",
        "==: Use this operator when you want to determine if two objects have the same value, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "is: Use this operator when you need to check if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory. This is often used for comparing with None (e.g., if x is None:).\n",

        "The is operator helps us check whether different variables point towards a similar object in the memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "Small integers and strings are often cached by Python for optimization. This means that even if you create two separate variables with the same small integer or string value, they might refer to the same object in memory, and the is operator would return True.\n",
